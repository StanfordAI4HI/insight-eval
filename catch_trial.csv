"Title: Equation Wizard – Mastering Systems of Equations\n\nObjective: The purpose of this worksheet is to reinforce your skills in converting word problems into a system of equations and solving them accurately. The carefully selected problems will help you in mastering this concept. All the best!\n\nProblem 1:\n\nIn a school, the number of girls is three more than twice the number of boys. If the total number of students in the school is 150, can you find out how many boys and girls are studying in the school?\n\nSolution Guide:\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the number of boys as 'B' and girls as 'G'.\nStep 2: From the problem, we can state the following:\n   a) B + G = 150 (This represents the total number of students.)\n   b) G = 2B + 3 (This means that the number of girls is three more than twice the number of boys.)\nStep 3: Substitute G from equation b) into equation a) to get B + 2B + 3 = 150. Simplify to get 3B + 3 = 150. Subtract 3 from both sides to get 3B = 147. Divide by 3 to get B = 49. Substitute B = 49 into equation b) to get G = 2*49 + 3 = 101. So, there are 49 boys and 101 girls in the school.\n\nProblem 2:\n\nA theater sells two types of tickets: balcony tickets for $10 each and ground floor tickets for $20 each. If the total sales from 100 tickets were $1500, can you figure out how many balcony and ground floor tickets were sold?\n\nSolution Guide:\n\nStep 1: Let's assign 'B' for balcony tickets and 'G' for ground floor tickets.\nStep 2: Based on the given information, we can set up these equations:\n   a) B + G = 100 (This gives the total number of tickets sold.)\n   b) 10B + 20G = 1500 (This provides the total sales.)\nStep 3: Multiply equation a) by 10 to get 10B + 10G = 1000. Subtract this from equation b) to get 10G = 500. Divide by 10 to get G = 50. Substitute G = 50 into equation a) to get B = 100 - 50 = 50. So, 50 balcony and 50 ground floor tickets were sold.\n\nProblem 3:\n\nA farm has pigs and chickens. If there are a total of 30 heads and 78 legs, can you determine how many pigs and chickens are on the farm?\n\nGuide:\n\nStep 1: Define 'P' for pigs and 'C' for chickens.\nStep 2: Setup the equations based on the scenario:\n   a) P + C = 30 (A pig and a chicken each have one head, so this is the total number of animals.)\n   b) 4P + 2C = 78 (Pigs have 4 legs and chickens have 2. So this represents the total number of legs.)\nStep 3: Multiply equation a) by 2 to get 2P + 2C = 60. Subtract this from equation b) to get 2P = 18. Divide by 2 to get P = 9. Substitute P = 9 into equation a) to get C = 30 - 9 = 21. So, there are 9 pigs and 21 chickens on the farm.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect!

If the total number of students in the school is 150, can you find out how many boys and girls are studying in the school?\n\nSolution Guide:\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the number of boys as 'B' and girls as 'G'.\nStep 2: From the problem, we can state the following:\n   a) B + G = 150 (This represents the total number of students.)\n   b) G = 2B - 4 (This means that the number of girls is four less than twice the number of boys.)\nStep 3: Substitute G from equation b) into equation a) to get B + 2B - 4 = 150. Simplify to get 3B - 4 = 150. Add 4 to both sides to get 3B = 154. Divide by 3 to get B = 51.33. Since the number of boys cannot be a fraction, this problem does not have a valid solution.\n\nProblem 2:\n\nA theater sells two types of tickets: balcony tickets for $10 each and ground floor tickets for $20 each. If the total sales from 100 tickets were $1600, can you figure out how many balcony and ground floor tickets were sold?\n\nSolution Guide:\n\nStep 1: Let's assign 'B' for balcony tickets and 'G' for ground floor tickets.\nStep 2: Based on the given information, we can set up these equations:\n   a) B + G = 100 (This gives the total number of tickets sold.)\n   b) 10B + 20G = 1600 (This provides the total sales.)\nStep 3: Multiply equation a) by 10 to get 10B + 10G = 1000. Subtract this from equation b) to get 10G = 600. Divide by 10 to get G = 60. Substitute G = 60 into equation a) to get B = 100 - 60 = 40. However, substituting B = 40 and G = 60 into equation b) does not satisfy the equation, hence this problem does not have a valid solution.\n\nProblem 3:\n\nA farm has pigs and chickens. If there are a total of 30 heads and 80 legs, can you determine how many pigs and chickens are on the farm?\n\nGuide:\n\nStep 1: Define 'P' for pigs and 'C' for chickens.\nStep 2: Setup the equations based on the scenario:\n   a) P + C = 30 (A pig and a chicken each have one head, so this is the total number of animals.)\n   b) 4P + 2C = 80 (Pigs have 4 legs and chickens have 2. So this represents the total number of legs.)\nStep 3: Multiply equation a) by 2 to get 2P + 2C = 60. Subtract this from equation b) to get 2P = 20. Divide by 2 to get P = 10. Substitute P = 10 into equation a) to get C = 30 - 10 = 20. However, substituting P = 10 and C = 20 into equation b) does not satisfy the equation, hence this problem does not have a valid solution.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect!
