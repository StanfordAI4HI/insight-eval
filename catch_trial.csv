Problem 1:

A theater sells two types of tickets: balcony tickets for $10 each and ground floor tickets for $20 each. If the total sales from 100 tickets were $1500, can you figure out how many balcony and ground floor tickets were sold?

Solution Guide:

Step 1: Let's assign 'B' for balcony tickets and 'G' for ground floor tickets.
Step 2: Based on the given information, we can set up these equations:
   a) B + G = 100 (This gives the total number of tickets sold.)
   b) 10B + 20G = 1500 (This provides the total sales.)
Step 3: Multiply equation a) by 10 to get 10B + 10G = 1000. Subtract this from equation b) to get 10G = 500. Divide by 10 to get G = 50. Substitute G = 50 into equation a) to get B = 100 - 50 = 50. So, 50 balcony and 50 ground floor tickets were sold.

Problem 2:

A farm has pigs and chickens. If there are a total of 30 heads and 78 legs, can you determine how many pigs and chickens are on the farm?

Guide:

Step 1: Define 'P' for pigs and 'C' for chickens.
Step 2: Setup the equations based on the scenario:
   a) P + C = 30 (A pig and a chicken each have one head, so this is the total number of animals.)
   b) 4P + 2C = 78 (Pigs have 4 legs and chickens have 2. So this represents the total number of legs.)
Step 3: Multiply equation a) by 2 to get 2P + 2C = 60. Subtract this from equation b) to get 2P = 18. Divide by 2 to get P = 9. Substitute P = 9 into equation a) to get C = 30 - 9 = 21. So, there are 9 pigs and 21 chickens on the farm.

Problem 1:

A theater sells two types of tickets: balcony tickets for $10 each and ground floor tickets for $20 each. If the total sales from 100 tickets were $1600, can you figure out how many balcony and ground floor tickets were sold?

Solution Guide:

Step 1: Let's assign 'B' for balcony tickets and 'G' for ground floor tickets.
Step 2: Based on the given information, we can set up these equations:
   a) B + G = 100 (This gives the total number of tickets sold.)
   b) 10B + 20G = 1600 (This provides the total sales.)
Step 3: Multiply equation a) by 10 to get 10B + 10G = 1000. Subtract this from equation b) to get 10G = 600. Divide by 10 to get G = 60. Substitute G = 60 into equation a) to get B = 100 - 60 = 40. However, substituting B = 40 and G = 60 into equation b) does not satisfy the equation, hence this problem does not have a valid solution.

Problem 2:

A farm has pigs and chickens. If there are a total of 30 heads and 80 legs, can you determine how many pigs and chickens are on the farm?

Guide:

Step 1: Define 'P' for pigs and 'C' for chickens.
Step 2: Setup the equations based on the scenario:
   a) P + C = 30 (A pig and a chicken each have one head, so this is the total number of animals.)
   b) 4P + 2C = 80 (Pigs have 4 legs and chickens have 2. So this represents the total number of legs.)
Step 3: Multiply equation a) by 2 to get 2P + 2C = 60. Subtract this from equation b) to get 2P = 20. Divide by 2 to get P = 10. Substitute P = 10 into equation a) to get C = 30 - 10 = 20. However, substituting P = 10 and C = 20 into equation b) does not satisfy the equation, hence this problem does not have a valid solution.
