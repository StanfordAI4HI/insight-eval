Title: Mastering Systems of Equations

Let's delve into more elaborate examples to enhance your skills in setting up and solving systems of equations.

Problem 1:
A movie theater sells two types of tickets: adults and children. The price of an adult ticket is $15 and the price of a child ticket is $8. If the total income from the sale of tickets on a certain day was $1200 and a total of 100 tickets were sold, how many adult and children tickets were sold that day? 
Remember the steps:
 - Identify your variables.
 - Write the system of equations based from the problem.
 - Solve the system of equations. 

Problem 2:
In a class, there are twice as many girls as boys. If the total number of students in the class is 45, how many boys and girls are there in the class? Set up and solve a system of equations to answer the question.

Problem 3:
A birdwatcher saw a group of birds in a tree. She counted 16 bird heads and 40 bird legs. If there were only parrots and crows on the tree, with parrots having 2 legs and crows having 4, how many parrots and crows did the birdwatcher see?

Problem 4:
Tim and Jim are saving money. Tim saves $5 per day while Jim saves $7 per day. After some days, Tim noticed that the total amount of money saved by them is $240. If they saved the same number of days, how many days did it take them to save that amount and how much did each of them save?

Remember the method:

Step 1: Understand what's being asked in the problem.
Step 2: Identify the unknowns and assign variables to them.
Step 3: Write down a system of equations that represent the problem.
Step 4: Solve the system of equations to find the solution.

Practicing these problems will strengthen your skills in both setting up and solving systems of equations. Don't get discouraged if you have difficulties at first. Keep practicing, and you'll improve!

Title: Mastering Systems of Equations Worksheet

Objective: This worksheet aims to further strengthen your ability in setting up and solving systems of equations. Read the problems carefully, identify the unknowns, set up the corresponding equations, and solve them step by step.

Problem 1: 
A fruit vendor sells apples and oranges in a day. An apple costs $2 and an orange costs $3. If the vendor sold 25 fruits for a total of $60, how many apples and oranges did the vendor sell?

Step-by-step Guide:
Consider the number of apples sold to be 'A' and the number of oranges sold to be 'O'.
Set up the two equations - 
a) A + O = 25, to represent the total number of fruits sold.
b) 2A + 3O = 60 to represent the total cost.
Now, solve these equations to find the values of A and O.

Problem 2:
In a bookstore, there are 3 times as many mysteries as there are biographies, and the total number of these two types of books is 80. How many of each type are there?

Step-by-step Guide:
Let's denote the number of mystery books as 'M' and biography books as 'B'.
Set up the two equations for this scenario - 
a) M + B = 80, as they add up to the total book count.
b) M = 3B, as there are thrice as many mysteries as biographies.
Solve these equations to find the values of M and B.

Problem 3:
A farmer has some chickens and cows. If the animals have a total of 50 heads and 140 legs, how many chickens and how many cows does he have?

Step-by-step Guide:
Assign the number of chickens as 'C' and cows as 'Co'.
Set up the equations -
a) C + Co = 50, as the total count of heads is 50.
b) 2C + 4Co = 140, as chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4, and the total legs are 140.
Now, solve these equations to find the values of C and Co.

Problem 4:
Two cars started driving from the same point in opposite directions. One car is driving at a speed of 40 miles per hour, and the second car at a speed of 60 miles per hour. How long will it take for the distance between them to be 500 miles?

Step-by-step Guide:
Let the time in hours be 'T'.
Since they are driving in opposite directions, you can add their speeds together.
The equation for this problem is 40T + 60T = 500.
Solve this equation to find the value of T.

Keep persevering and practicing. Remember to verify your solutions to make sure they satisfy all the conditions given in the word problem. Remember that success comes with patience, effort, and practice.
