Strengthening your understanding of setting up and solving systems of equations is important. As such, let's work through these problems:

1. Problem: 

There are 10 dogs and cats altogether in an animal shelter. The total number of dog legs is 28, and the total number of cat legs is 16. How many dogs and how many cats are there at the shelter?

Solution:
Step 1: Let's denote the number of dogs as D and the number of cats as C.
Step 2: From the problem, we know that D + C = 10 (since there are 10 dogs and cats altogether).
Step 3: We also understand that each dog has 4 legs and each cat has 4 legs too. So, 4D (total dog legs) + 4C (total cat legs) = 28 (dog legs) + 16 (cat legs) = 44.
Step 4: We now have two equations. They are D + C = 10 and 4D + 4C = 44.
Step 5: Try solving these equations simultaneously to obtain values for D and C. This is how many dogs and cats are in the shelter.


2. Problem: 

John and Mary have a total of 50 drawings. Mary has 8 drawings more than John. How many drawings does each person have?

Solution:
Step 1: Let the number of drawings John has be represented by J, and the number of drawings Mary has be denoted by M.
Step 2: From the provided information, we can write down two equations: 
  a) J + M = 50 (because together, they have 50 drawings).
  b) M = J + 8 (since Mary has 8 drawings more than John).
Step 3: Now, you have a set of equations. Try solving these equations to figure out the number of drawings each person has.


Remember, setting up the equations accurately based on the given information is an important step to solving these problems. Practice until you get comfortable.

Strengthening your understanding of setting up and solving systems of equations is important. As such, let's work through these problems:

1. Problem: 

There are 10 dogs and cats altogether in an animal shelter. The total number of dog legs is 28, and the total number of cat legs is 16. How many dogs and how many cats are there at the shelter?

Solution:
Step 1: Let's denote the number of dogs as D and the number of cats as C.
Step 2: From the problem, we know that D + C = 10 (since there are 10 dogs and cats altogether).
Step 3: We also understand that each dog has 4 legs and each cat has 4 legs too. So, 4D (total dog legs) + 4C (total cat legs) = 28 (dog legs) + 16 (cat legs) = 44.
Step 4: We now have two equations. They are D + C = 10 and 4D + 4C = 44.
Step 5: Try solving these equations simultaneously to obtain values for D and C. This is how many dogs and cats are in the shelter.


2. Problem: 

John and Mary have a total of 50 drawings. Mary has 8 drawings more than John. How many drawings does each person have?

Solution:
Step 1: Let the number of drawings John has be represented by J, and the number of drawings Mary has be denoted by M.
Step 2: From the provided information, we can write down two equations: 
  a) J + M = 50 (because together, they have 50 drawings).
  b) M = J + 8 (since Mary has 8 drawings more than John).

Objective: Our aim in this worksheet is to help you become proficient with systems of equations, teaching you how to create and solve them starting with word problems.

Problem 1:
A bookstore sells two types of books - fiction and non-fiction. Each fiction book costs $5, and each non-fiction book costs $7. If the bookstore sold 45 books and earned $250 in total, how many of each type of book did they sell?

Guideline:
Step 1: Let's represent the number of fiction books as 'F' and non-fiction books as 'NF'.
Step 2: From the problem, we can derive two equations: 
  a) F + NF = 45 (Because they sold 45 books in total).
  b) 5F + 7NF = 250 (Since each fiction book costs $5 and each non-fiction $7, and the total is $250).
Step 3: Solve these two equations to find out how many fiction and non-fiction books were sold.

Problem 2:
In a school, the number of 9th graders is 3 less than twice the number of 8th graders. If the total number of 8th and 9th graders is 105, how many 8th graders and how many 9th graders are there?

Guideline:
Step 1: Denote the number of 8th graders as '8G' and 9th graders as '9G'.
Step 2: We can form our equations from the problem like this:
    a) 8G + 9G = 105 (as combined they have 105 students).
    b) 9G = 2*8G - 3 (Given that the number of 9th graders is three less than twice the number if 8th graders).
Step 3: Try solving these two equations to find how many students are in each grade.

Problem 3:
A zoo has two kinds of birds, parrots and flamingos. Each parrot has 2 legs, and each flamingo has 2 legs. If there were 200 legs and 76 birds in total, how many parrots and flamingos are there?

Guideline:
Step 1: Let the number of parrots be 'P' and the number of flamingos be 'F'.
Step 2: Set up the following equations based on the problem:
a) P + F = 76 (since there are 76 birds in total).
b) 2P + 2F = 200 (as both types of birds have 2 legs each, totalling 200 legs).
Step 3: Solve these equations together to find the number of 'P' parrots and 'F' flamingos.

Problem 4:
Two friends, Lisa and Lana, decided to sell their old comic books. The number of comic books Lisa sold was 4 more than twice the number Lana sold. If they sold 58 comic books in total, how many comics books did each one sell?

Guideline:
Step 1: Let 'L' denote Lisa's comic books and 'La' denote Lana's.
Step 2: Formulate two equations:
- L + La = 58 (This represents the total number of comic books sold. )
- L = 2La + 4 (This indicates that Lisa sold four more than twice the number of comic books Lana sold.) 
Step 3: Solve these two equations to find out the number of comic books each person sold.

Remember, practice and reviewing your solutions is crucial. Don't get disheartened if you don't solve it at first, it takes time. Keep at it!
