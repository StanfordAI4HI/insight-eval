"You need to study a problem and its solution. Here's the problem: 
A brownie recipe is asking for 350 grams of sugar, and a pound cake recipe requires 270 more grams of sugar than a brownie recipe. How many grams of sugar are needed for the pound cake? Here's its solution:
Step 1: Identify the amount of sugar needed for the brownie recipe, which is 350 grams.
Step 2: Understand that the pound cake recipe requires 270 more grams of sugar than the brownie recipe.
Step 3: Add the additional 270 grams of sugar to the 350 grams required for the brownie recipe.
Step 4: The total amount of sugar needed for the pound cake recipe is 350 grams + 270 grams = 620 grams.

Today we are going to be working on setting up and solving systems of equations from word problems. This is a two-step process: first, we need to be able to correctly translate the word problem into equations (setting up the system) and second, solve the system of equations. Let's get started!

Activity 1:
Start with this problem related to sugar usage, somewhat similar to the previous one.
""A chocolate cake recipe requires 400 grams of sugar, and a cheesecake recipe needs 320 grams more sugar than the chocolate cake. How many grams of sugar does the cheesecake need?""

Now let's break this problem down together:

Step 1: Determine the amount of sugar needed for the chocolate cake, which is 400 grams.
Step 2: Understand that the cheesecake requires 320 more grams of sugar than the chocolate cake.
Step 3: Add the additional 320 grams of sugar to the 400 grams needed for the chocolate cake.
Step 4: The total amount of sugar required for the cheesecake recipe is 400 grams + 320 grams = 720 grams.

Activity 2:
Here's a word problem for you to practice setting up a system of equations.
""Sarah has twice as many stamps as John. Together, they have 90 stamps. How many stamps does each person have?""

Try to solve this problem by following these steps:
Step 1: Let's call the number of stamps Sarah has ""S"" and the number of stamps John has ""J"".
Step 2: We know that Sarah has twice as many stamps as John. This can be written as an equation: S = 2J.
Step 3: We also know that Sarah and John together have 90 stamps. This can be written as another equation: S + J = 90.
Step 4: Solve these equations to find out how many stamps each person has.

Activity 3:
Now, let's solve a system of equations. Here's the problem:
""Bob is five years older than Alice. Two years from now, he will be twice her age. How old are Bob and Alice currently?""

Here's how to approach this system of equations:
Step 1: Let's call Bob's age ""B"" and Alice's age ""A"".
Step 2: From the problem, we know that Bob is five years older than Alice, so we can write that as: B = A + 5.
Step 3: Two years from now, Bob will be twice Alice's age. So we can write that as: (B+2) = 2*(A+2).
Step 4: Solve these equations to find out Bob's and Alice's current ages.

Remember, practice is key. Make sure to solve multiple problems of this kind to get a strong grasp on setting up and solving systems of equations.

Title: Practice Worksheet - Systems of Equations 

Problem 1:
Jenny is saving money to buy a new video game which costs $75. She has already saved $20. If Jenny saves $10 per week, how many weeks will Jenny need to save to buy the video game? Write down the equation for the problem and solve it.

Problem 2:
John and Mary are selling lemonade. John sells a cup of lemonade for $5 and Mary sells it for $4. If 20 people came to their stand today, and they made a total of $90, how many cups did each of them sell? Formulate a system of equations to represent this situation and solve it.

Problem 3:
Two cars are traveling towards each other from a distance of 1000 miles apart. The first car is traveling at a speed of 50 miles per hour, and the other car is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour. In how many hours will the two cars meet? Write down the equations that represent this situation and solve them.

Problem 4:
You find a book and a pen and you observe the total price for both is $22. However, the book costs $3 more than twice the price of the pen. Can you find the price for each item? Formulate the system of equations and solve it.

Remember the steps to solve:

1. Understand the problem and what itâ€™s asking.
2. Identify your variables.
3. Write down a system of equations that represent the problem.
4. Solve the system of equations.
