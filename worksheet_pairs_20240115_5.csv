Title: Mastering Systems of Equations

Let's delve into more elaborate examples to enhance your skills in setting up and solving systems of equations.

Problem 1:
A movie theater sells two types of tickets: adults and children. The price of an adult ticket is $15 and the price of a child ticket is $8. If the total income from the sale of tickets on a certain day was $1200 and a total of 100 tickets were sold, how many adult and children tickets were sold that day? 
Remember the steps:
 - Identify your variables.
 - Write the system of equations based from the problem.
 - Solve the system of equations. 

Problem 2:
In a class, there are twice as many girls as boys. If the total number of students in the class is 45, how many boys and girls are there in the class? Set up and solve a system of equations to answer the question.

Problem 3:
A birdwatcher saw a group of birds in a tree. She counted 16 bird heads and 40 bird legs. If there were only parrots and crows on the tree, with parrots having 2 legs and crows having 4, how many parrots and crows did the birdwatcher see?

Problem 4:
Tim and Jim are saving money. Tim saves $5 per day while Jim saves $7 per day. After some days, Tim noticed that the total amount of money saved by them is $240. If they saved the same number of days, how many days did it take them to save that amount and how much did each of them save?

Remember the method:

Step 1: Understand what's being asked in the problem.
Step 2: Identify the unknowns and assign variables to them.
Step 3: Write down a system of equations that represent the problem.
Step 4: Solve the system of equations to find the solution.

Practicing these problems will strengthen your skills in both setting up and solving systems of equations. Don't get discouraged if you have difficulties at first. Keep practicing, and you'll improve!

Title: System of Equations Expert Breakdown

Objective: Our aim in this worksheet is to help you become proficient with systems of equations, teaching you how to create and solve them starting with word problems.

Problem 1:
A bookstore sells two types of books - fiction and non-fiction. Each fiction book costs $5, and each non-fiction book costs $7. If the bookstore sold 45 books and earned $250 in total, how many of each type of book did they sell?

Guideline:
Step 1: Let's represent the number of fiction books as 'F' and non-fiction books as 'NF'.
Step 2: From the problem, we can derive two equations: 
  a) F + NF = 45 (Because they sold 45 books in total).
  b) 5F + 7NF = 250 (Since each fiction book costs $5 and each non-fiction $7, and the total is $250).
Step 3: Solve these two equations to find out how many fiction and non-fiction books were sold.

Problem 2:
In a school, the number of 9th graders is 3 less than twice the number of 8th graders. If the total number of 8th and 9th graders is 105, how many 8th graders and how many 9th graders are there?

Guideline:
Step 1: Denote the number of 8th graders as '8G' and 9th graders as '9G'.
Step 2: We can form our equations from the problem like this:
    a) 8G + 9G = 105 (as combined they have 105 students).
    b) 9G = 2*8G - 3 (Given that the number of 9th graders is three less than twice the number if 8th graders).
Step 3: Try solving these two equations to find how many students are in each grade.

Problem 3:
A zoo has two kinds of birds, parrots and flamingos. Each parrot has 2 legs, and each flamingo has 2 legs. If there were 200 legs and 76 birds in total, how many parrots and flamingos are there?

Guideline:
Step 1: Let the number of parrots be 'P' and the number of flamingos be 'F'.
Step 2: Set up the following equations based on the problem:
a) P + F = 76 (since there are 76 birds in total).
b) 2P + 2F = 200 (as both types of birds have 2 legs each, totalling 200 legs).
Step 3: Solve these equations together to find the number of 'P' parrots and 'F' flamingos.

Problem 4:
Two friends, Lisa and Lana, decided to sell their old comic books. The number of comic books Lisa sold was 4 more than twice the number Lana sold. If they sold 58 comic books in total, how many comics books did each one sell?

Guideline:
Step 1: Let 'L' denote Lisa's comic books and 'La' denote Lana's.
Step 2: Formulate two equations:
- L + La = 58 (This represents the total number of comic books sold. )
- L = 2La + 4 (This indicates that Lisa sold four more than twice the number of comic books Lana sold.) 
Step 3: Solve these two equations to find out the number of comic books each person sold.

Remember, practice and reviewing your solutions is crucial. Don't get disheartened if you don't solve it at first, it takes time. Keep at it!

  a) F + NF = 45 (Because they sold 45 books in total).
  b) 5F + 7NF = 250 (Since each fiction book costs $5 and each non-fiction $7, and the total is $250).
Step 3: Solve these two equations to find out how many fiction and non-fiction books were sold.

Problem 2:
In a school, the number of 9th graders is 3 less than twice the number of 8th graders. If the total number of 8th and 9th graders is 105, how many 8th graders and how many 9th graders are there?

Guideline:
Step 1: Denote the number of 8th graders as '8G' and 9th graders as '9G'.
Step 2: We can form our equations from the problem like this:
    a) 8G + 9G = 105 (as combined they have 105 students).
    b) 9G = 2*8G - 3 (Given that the number of 9th graders is three less than twice the number if 8th graders).
Step 3: Try solving these two equations to find how many students are in each grade.

Problem 3:
A zoo has two kinds of birds, parrots and flamingos. Each parrot has 2 legs, and each flamingo has 2 legs. If there were 200 legs and 76 birds in total, how many parrots and flamingos are there?

Guideline:
Step 1: Let the number of parrots be 'P' and the number of flamingos be 'F'.
Step 2: Set up the following equations based on the problem:
a) P + F = 76 (since there are 76 birds in total).
b) 2P + 2F = 200 (as both types of birds have 2 legs each, totalling 200 legs).
Step 3: Solve these equations together to find the number of 'P' parrots and 'F' flamingos.

Problem 4:
Two friends, Lisa and Lana, decided to sell their old comic books. The number of comic books Lisa sold was 4 more than twice the number Lana sold. If they sold 58 comic books in total, how many comics books did each one sell?

Guideline:
Step 1: Let 'L' denote Lisa's comic books and 'La' denote Lana's.
Step 2: Formulate two equations:
- L + La = 58 (This represents the total number of comic books sold. )
- L = 2La + 4 (This indicates that Lisa sold four more than twice the number of comic books Lana sold.) 
Step 3: Solve these two equations to find out the number of comic books each person sold.

Remember, practice and reviewing your solutions is crucial. Don't get disheartened if you don't solve it at first, it takes time. Keep at it!
