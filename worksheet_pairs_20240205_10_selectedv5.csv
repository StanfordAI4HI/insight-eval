Objective: Our aim in this worksheet is to help you become proficient with systems of equations, teaching you how to create and solve them starting with word problems.

Problem 1:
A bookstore sells two types of books - fiction and non-fiction. Each fiction book costs $5, and each non-fiction book costs $7. If the bookstore sold 45 books and earned $250 in total, how many of each type of book did they sell?

Guideline:
Step 1: Let's represent the number of fiction books as 'F' and non-fiction books as 'NF'.
Step 2: From the problem, we can derive two equations: 
  a) F + NF = 45 (Because they sold 45 books in total).
  b) 5F + 7NF = 250 (Since each fiction book costs $5 and each non-fiction $7, and the total is $250).
Step 3: Solve these two equations to find out how many fiction and non-fiction books were sold.

Problem 2:
In a school, the number of 9th graders is 3 less than twice the number of 8th graders. If the total number of 8th and 9th graders is 105, how many 8th graders and how many 9th graders are there?

Guideline:
Step 1: Denote the number of 8th graders as '8G' and 9th graders as '9G'.
Step 2: We can form our equations from the problem like this:
    a) 8G + 9G = 105 (as combined they have 105 students).
    b) 9G = 2*8G - 3 (Given that the number of 9th graders is three less than twice the number if 8th graders).
Step 3: Try solving these two equations to find how many students are in each grade.

Problem 3:
A zoo has two kinds of birds, parrots and flamingos. Each parrot has 2 legs, and each flamingo has 2 legs. If there were 200 legs and 76 birds in total, how many parrots and flamingos are there?

Guideline:
Step 1: Let the number of parrots be 'P' and the number of flamingos be 'F'.
Step 2: Set up the following equations based on the problem:
a) P + F = 76 (since there are 76 birds in total).
b) 2P + 2F = 200 (as both types of birds have 2 legs each, totalling 200 legs).
Step 3: Solve these equations together to find the number of 'P' parrots and 'F' flamingos.

Problem 4:
Two friends, Lisa and Lana, decided to sell their old comic books. The number of comic books Lisa sold was 4 more than twice the number Lana sold. If they sold 58 comic books in total, how many comics books did each one sell?

Guideline:
Step 1: Let 'L' denote Lisa's comic books and 'La' denote Lana's.
Step 2: Formulate two equations:
- L + La = 58 (This represents the total number of comic books sold. )
- L = 2La + 4 (This indicates that Lisa sold four more than twice the number of comic books Lana sold.) 
Step 3: Solve these two equations to find out the number of comic books each person sold.

Remember, practice and reviewing your solutions is crucial. Don't get disheartened if you don't solve it at first, it takes time. Keep at it!

Title: System of Equations - Expert Wizardry 

Objective: The goal of this worksheet is to enable you to master the art of forming and solving system of equations from word problems. The word problems selected will give you the exposure to a wide range of scenarios in which system of equations can be applied.

Problem 1: 
A local grocery store sells apples and oranges. If the store sold a total of 36 fruits in a day, and the number of oranges sold was three times the number of apples sold, how many apples and how many oranges were sold?

Instructions:
Step 1: Denote the number of apples sold with 'A' and oranges sold with 'O'.
Step 2: From the information, form the following equations -
       a) A + O = 36 (Total number of fruits sold),
       b) O = 3A (Number of oranges is three times the number of apples).
Step 3: Now you have two equations. Try solving these equations to find the number of apples and oranges sold.

Problem 2: 
In a school, there are a total of 300 students in 8th and 9th grade. The number of 8th graders is 20 less than twice the number of 9th graders. How many students are in each grade?

Instructions:
Step 1: Assign 'E' to represent the number of 8th graders and 'N' to represent the number of 9th graders.
Step 2: The two equations that could be formed from the information given would be -
       a) E + N = 300 (Combined total of students),
       b) E = 2N - 20 (Number of 8th graders is 20 less than twice the number of 9th graders).
Step 3: Resolving these equations will give you the number of students in each grade.

Problem 3:
At a car parking lot, there are motorbikes and cars. If the total number of vehicles is 50 and the total number of wheels is 160, how many motorbikes and cars are there?

Instructions:
Step 1: Define the number of motorbikes as 'M' and cars as 'C'.
Step 2: Since motorbikes have 2 wheels and cars have 4, we can write the equations: 
       a) M + C = 50 (total number of vehicles),
       b) 2M + 4C = 160 (total number of wheels).
Step 3: Solving these equations will provide the quantity of motorbikes and cars.

Problem 4:
Two friends, Alex and Sam, have a total of 80 comic books. If Alex has 6 comic books fewer than twice the number of comic books that Sam does, how many comic books does each person have?

Instructions:
Step 1: Use 'A' to denote the number of books Alex has and 'S' for the books Sam has.
Step 2: Two equations can be made from the given conditions -
    a) A + S = 80 (combined sum of comic books),
    b) A = 2S - 6 (Alex has 6 fewer books than twice the number Sam has).
Step 3: Try solving these equations to determine the number of comic books each person has.

Keep working on the problems diligently, and remember to recheck your answers. Don't rush; accuracy is more crucial than speed.
